- **✅ Add borders to cards** when they're on the same background color
- **✅ Use subtle borders** - `border border-gray-100` or `border border-[var(--color-border)]`
- **✅ Cards should use white backgrounds** for contrast against colored sections
- **✅ Borders provide visual separation** between cards and container

- **✅ Icons must be vertically aligned** with text baseline

#### Component Usage Rules
- **❌ Never create custom implementations** when QDS components exist
- **✅ Always use QDS Tabs component** instead of custom button groups
- **✅ Use Button component** with proper `icon` and `iconPosition` props
- **✅ Use Icon wrapper component** with `name` prop, not direct Lucide imports
- **✅ Use Typography component** with proper variants
- **✅ Use Card components** (PropertyCard, TenantCard, etc.) from QDS
